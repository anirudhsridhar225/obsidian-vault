dear diary,

today's prompt, as always provided by anuhya is "What's something that I'm not being honest with myself about"

a lot of things, if I'm being honest. mostly when it comes to change, be it in my lifestyle, or the things I use etc. i wouldn't say I'm _extremely_ resistant to change, but I will resist to a certain degree to have things be the way they already are, mostly because i have a tendency to tinker with/optimise things till I feel like I've obtained a state of equilibrium, so I don't want to let go of that. that's the long excuse, the short excuse being that I'm a supremely lazy human being. i think that has been pretty evident with how I've been filling this journal (?), although half of that can be attributed to procrastination and being scatterbrained.

i generally don't lie to other people, partly because i hate being dishonest and also because every time throughout my life i have lied, it's led to extremely bad things, case in point the whole issue last September.
