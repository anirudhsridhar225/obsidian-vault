Hierarchical State Planning

- break down complex tasks into a hierarchical structure of small sub-tasks or actions that can be executed by an intelligent agent
- usually called hierarchical task network planning (HTN planning)
- reduces size of search space

# Steps
1. identify hierarchy of conditions
2. construct a plan in levels, postponing details to the next level
3. perform hierarchical planning using abstraction based STRIPS (ABSTRIPS)(yap)
