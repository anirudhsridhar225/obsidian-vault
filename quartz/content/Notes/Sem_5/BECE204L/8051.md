EA - external access
ale/prog - address latch enable --> 8031 to external memory
- when ale = 1 => p0 work as data bus
- when ale = 0 => p0 work as address bus
psen - program store enable
- used in romless (8031-based) systems to allow storage of program code in external ROM
# machine cycles

- cpu takes certain no. of clock cycles to execute an instr
- 1 machine cycle = min. amt. of time in which a single 8051 instr can be executed = 12 clock pulses
- generally operates with a crystal frequency of 11.0582 MHz
	- freq = 11.0852*1000/12 = 921583 single cycle instr/s
	- time period = 1/921583 = 1.085 $\mu$s
