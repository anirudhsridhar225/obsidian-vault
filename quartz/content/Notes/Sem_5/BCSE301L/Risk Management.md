Risk mitigation, monitoring and management

---
### Steps for Mitigating Risks:

1. **Communicate** with concerned staff to find off probable risk.
2. **Removing all causes** that are the reason for risk creation.
3. **Develop a policy** in an organization which will help to continue the project.
4. **Controlling the corresponding documents** from time to time.
5. **Conducting timely reviews** to speed up the work.

### Risk Monitoring

- **Definition**: Risk monitoring is an activity used to **track a project's progress**.
- **Performed by**: Project Manager.

---

### Objectives of Risk Monitoring Process:

1. To check if **predicted risks occur or not**.
2. To ensure proper application of **risk avoidance measures**.
3. To **gather information** for future risk assessments.
4. To determine **which risks generate which problems** throughout the project.

### Risk Management Flow:

```plaintext
If (RISK is avoidable)
{
    1. Risk Mitigation.
    2. Risk Monitoring.
}
else
{
    3. Risk Management.
}
```

### Notes on Risk Management:

- **Reactive approach**: Apply after risks have been generated.
- Assumes **mitigation activity failed**, and the risk is present in reality.
- Task performed by the **Project Manager** who solves the generated risks.
- Effective use of **project mitigation** helps remove risks successfully, making management easier.

---

### Example Scenario:

**Scenario**: Many people leave the organization.  
The risks can be mitigated if:

- **Sufficient additional staff** is available.
- **Current development activity knowledge** is shared across the team.
- **Systematic documentation** is maintained.
