A covering in a graph is a subgraph that either contains
- All vertices --> Edge covering
- All edges --> Vertex covering
corresponding to some other graph.

## Vertex Covering Set
A subset $D ⊆ V$ of a vertex set G is said to be a vertex covering set if every edge $e ∈ E(G)$ is incident to at least one vertex in D.

The vertex covering number of a graph G is the minimum cardinality among all vertex covering sets in $G$.

## Edge covering Set
A subset $F ⊆ E$ of a edge set G is said to be a edge covering set if every edge $v ∈ V(G)$ is incident to at least one edge in F.

The edge covering number of a graph G is the minimum cardinality among all edge covering sets in $G$.
