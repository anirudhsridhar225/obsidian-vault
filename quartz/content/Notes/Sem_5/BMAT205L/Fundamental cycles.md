Let $T$ be a spanning tree. Adding any one chord to $T$ will create a cycle, which is known as the fundamental cycle.

Here, the fundamental cycle is $v2, v4, v3, v2$

# Fundamental Cut-set

The cut-set that contains an edge $e$ from ST $T$ and a number of chords which preserve the same partition is called the `fundamental cut-set` corresponding to $T$.

All 4 ($c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4$) are fundamental cut-sets

## Properties
1. Every edge is a cut-set in a tree.
2. Every cut-set in a connected graph $G$ must contain at least one branch of every ST of $G$.
3. Every chord defines a unique fundamental cycle.
4. Every branch defines a unique fundamental cut-set.
