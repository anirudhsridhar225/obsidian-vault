# The seven principles
1. Decentralization
2. Immutability
3. Transparency
4. Security
5. Scalability
6. Privacy
7. Flexibility

## Decentralization

allows for trustless transactions and eliminates needing a third party to verify transactions.

## Immutability

all data and transactions on the chain are permanent and unchangeable.

## Transparency

all information associated with a transaction is always available to the user.

## Security

every time a new block is created and added, it needs to meet certain conditions to be eligible to be added.

as long as 51% of all miners approve the new block, it will get added and the transaction info will be available to everyone.

this verification process ensures decentralization and security.

## Scalability

scalability has three main factors that need to be taken care of:

1. execution
2. storage
3. consensus

### execution

speed at which each transaction is processed and completed on a blockchain network.

some factors include:

1. number of nodes in the network
2. processing power of each node
3. available bandwidth

### storage

amount of data that can be stored on a blockchain network. size of the blockchain and frequency at which they generated are crucial factors.

### consensus

agreement of all nodes involved in a blockchain system about which transaction is valid and which is not. this can be done by voting or a [[Proof of Work]] algorithm.

## Privacy

verifies the transparency of data and transactions on the network, providing users with a degree of trustworthiness

it also allows for greater accountability since everyone involved with a blockchain project is publicly visible.

there are usually two options:

1. use strong cryptography and ensure all the network nodes are reliable and honest
2. private blockchain network may also be beneficial, compared to a public one

## Flexibility

how swiftly and precisely transactions can be carried out, how streamlined and manageable.
