# Information Retrieval models
An IR model governs how a document and query are represented and how the relevance of a document to a user query is defined.

Main models:
1. [[Boolean model]]
2. [[Vector space model]]
3. Random surfer model

Precision = (Number of relevant items retrieved) / (Total number of retrieved items)

Recall = (Number of relevant items retrieved) / (Total number of relevant items)
