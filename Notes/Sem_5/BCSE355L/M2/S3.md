### *Simple Storage Service*

- Persistent storage
- High durability, throughput, low latency
- Each files becomes an object
- located using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- Can be accessed from anywhere
- Used to securely collect, store and analyze data on a massive scale
- Divided into buckets where objects are stored
- 99.999999999% (11 9s) data durability
- Store as many objects as you want, object size up to 5TB
- Access objects using a REST API through HTTP/HTTPS

### Types:
1) S3 Standard
	- Performance sensitive
	- Frequent access
	- Default class

2) S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	- Optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost effective tier without performance impact or cost overhead
	- > 30 days => S3 Infrequent Access
	- No additional fee

3) S3 Standard IA (Infrequent Access)
	- Less frequent access
	- But needs rapid access when needed
	- Long term storage usually for backups and DR (disaster recovery) files

4) S3 One Zone IA
	- Same as S3 Standard IA but stores data only in 1 AZ

5) S3 Glacier
	- Secure, durable, low-cost storage for data archiving
	- Competitive costs
	- Types:
		1) S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
		2) S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

6) S3 Glacier Deep Archive
	- Lowest cost storage class
	- Long term retention and digital preservation
	- Used in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare
	- Data accessed once or twice a year

### Access S3:
1) AWS console
2) AWS CLI
3) AWS SDK
4) API

### S3 Versioning:
- Bucket level version control for each object
- Provides a way to recover data in cases of failure/accidental overwrites
- Only the diffs are tracked
- 3 stages - Unversioned, Versioning-enabled, Versioning-suspended

### S3 Lifecycle management:
- Lifecycle Actions:
	1) Transition Actions: When objects transition to a different class
	2) Expiration Actions: When objects expire (AWS deleted these automatically)
- Lifecycle Policies:
	- Set rules to objects/buckets to perform actions
