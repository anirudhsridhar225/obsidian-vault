# Hello, and welcome

This is my **Obsidian Vault**, now live as a clean, browsable website thanks to Quartz v4. You'll find:

-  **Notes by Topic**: Organized collections of thoughts, articles, or deep-dives into subjects I care about.
-  **Daily Journals**: (If you use them) Track progress, ideas, moods—whatever you log to reflect.
-  **Resources & References**: Research, links, and reference material for quick look-up.
-  **Projects & TODOs**: Personal to-dos, plans, and active projects.

---

## Navigation Tips

-  Use the sidebar or website navigation to explore by **tags**, **folders**, or **recent updates**.
-  The search bar helps you zip directly to what you're after.
-  All links are **Obsidian-flavored**, so wiki-style links like `[[Some Note]]` and embedded media work seamlessly.

## What’s Next?

I update this vault often. New sections, reflections, and reorganizations land here as soon as I push updates. If you’re digging in—hope you find something useful or inspiring.
